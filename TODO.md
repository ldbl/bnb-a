- [ ] Create performance dashboard
- [ ] Validate with historical swing trades

### 2.3 Data Integration
- [ ] Test `data_fetcher.py` with monthly data
- [ ] Validate feature engineering for swing trading
- [ ] Optimize data pipeline

## 🔧 Week 3: Advanced Features & Production

### 3.1 On-chain Integration
